# Dataset of cross-view image pairs & image-based geolocalization methods.

## Introduction

To evaluate the effect of cross-view image-based geo-localization method under real scenes, we build up our cross-view image dataset. Different with CVUSA or CVACT, our cross-view image dataset is **the first cross-view image dataset contains heading data** and are collected in real scenarios. It also including different settings such as spatial resolution and north alignment.

The siamese network model used for image retrieval will be uploaded soon.
